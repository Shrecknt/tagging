A really bad file host

## Usage

Although there is currently no docker container, it will likely be added in the future

-   `git clone` the repository
-   Make a `.env` file and configure it to your liking
-   Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
-   Build the project with `npm run build`
-   Run `npm start` to start the webserver
